# Alchemist

An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents to produce mystical effects. Alchemists use their creations to give life and to leech it away.

Before you, the bubbling flask turns a deep emerald green, sending up a puff of purple smoke. This is the power of alchemy—transforming base materials into magical substances.
