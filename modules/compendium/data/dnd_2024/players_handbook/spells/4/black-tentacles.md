# Black Tentacles
*4th-Level Conjuration (Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 90 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a tentacle)
**Duration:** 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the du- ration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into Difficult Terrain. Each creature in that area makes a Strength sav- ing throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn. A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.
