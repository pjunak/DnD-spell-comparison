# Disintegrate
*6th-Level Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and dust)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by Wall of Force.

A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 Hit Points, it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a True Resurrection or a Wish spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-Cube portion of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 3d6 for each spell slot level above 6.
