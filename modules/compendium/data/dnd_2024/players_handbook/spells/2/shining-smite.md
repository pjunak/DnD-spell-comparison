*2nd-Level Transmutation (Paladin)*
**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V

The target hit by the strike takes an extra 2d6 Radiant damage from the attack. Until the spell ends, the target sheds Bright Light in a 5-foot radius, attack rolls against it have Advantage, and it can’t benefit from the Invisible condition.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 2.
