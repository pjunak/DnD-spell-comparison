# Acid Arrow
*2nd-Level Evocation (Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 90 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid dam- age at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.**  The damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 2.
