Your strike rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you, and the target takes an extra 2d6 Thunder damage from the attack. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and have the Prone condition.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.
