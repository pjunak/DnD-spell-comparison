*5th-Level Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (C)
**Duration:** C, up to 1 minute

You imbue yourself with the elemental power of genies. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

**Elemental Immunity.** When you cast this spell, choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. You have Resistance to the chosen damage type.

**Elemental Pulse.** When you cast this spell and at the start of each of your subsequent turns, you release a burst of elemental energy in a 15-foot Emanation originating from yourself. Each creature of your choice in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice) and has the Prone condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

**Flight.** You gain a Fly Speed of 30 feet and can hover.

**Casting as a Circle Spell.** If the spell is cast as a Circle spell, its casting time increases to 1 minute, and its duration increases to Concentration, up to 10 minutes. For each secondary caster who participates in the casting, you can choose one additional creature, to a maximum of nine additional creatures. The chosen creatures also gain the benefits of the spell for its duration.

When the spell is cast, each secondary caster must expend a level 2+ spell slot; otherwise, the spell fails.
