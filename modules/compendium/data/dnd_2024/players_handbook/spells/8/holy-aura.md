# Holy Aura
*8th-Level Abjuration (Cleric)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (a reliquary worth 1,000+ GP)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you emit an aura in a 30-foot Emanation. While in the aura, creatures of your choice have Advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls against them.
