# Remove Curse
*3rd-Level Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner’s Attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
