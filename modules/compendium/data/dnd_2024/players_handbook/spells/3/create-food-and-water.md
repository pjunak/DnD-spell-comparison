# Create Food And Water
*3rd-Level Conjuration (Artificer, Cleric, Paladin)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of fresh water on the ground or in containers within range - both useful in fending off the hazards of malnutrition and dehydration. The food is bland but nourishing and looks like a food of your choice, and the water is clean. The food spoils after 24 hours if uneaten.
