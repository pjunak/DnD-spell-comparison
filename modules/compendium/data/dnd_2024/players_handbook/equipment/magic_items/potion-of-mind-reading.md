*Potion, Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [Detect Thoughts](/spells/2619099-detect-thoughts) spell (save DC 13) for 10 minutes (no [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) required).

This potion’s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.
