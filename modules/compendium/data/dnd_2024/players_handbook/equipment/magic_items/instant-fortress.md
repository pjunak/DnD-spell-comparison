You can accept this 1-inch metal cube to place it on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it.
The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. The interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof.
**Durability:** The fortress is made of adamantine, has 100 hit points, and immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons.
