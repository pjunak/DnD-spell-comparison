*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While holding or wearing this talisman, you have Advantage on any Intelligence ([Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check you make to control a [Sphere of Annihilation](/magic-items/9229086-sphere-of-annihilation). In addition, when you start your turn in control of a *Sphere of Annihilation*, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to move it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier. This movement doesn’t have to be in a straight line.
