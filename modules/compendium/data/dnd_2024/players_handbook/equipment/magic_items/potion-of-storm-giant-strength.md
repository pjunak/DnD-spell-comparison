# Potion of Storm Giant Strength

*Potion, Legendary*

When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes to **29** for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of light resembling a giant’s fingernail.
