*Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While you’re wearing this armor, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action and use a command word to gain the effect of the [Etherealness](/spells/2619193-etherealness) spell. The spell ends immediately if you remove the armor or take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to repeat the command word. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.
