*Potion, Rare*

This potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink the potion, you have the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition for 1 hour. The effect ends early if you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.
