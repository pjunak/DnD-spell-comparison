*Potion, Very Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [Haste](/spells/2619141-haste) spell for 1 minute (no Concentration required) without suffering the wave of lethargy that typically occurs when the effect ends.

This potion’s yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.
