*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

**All-Around Vision.** The robe gives you Advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks that rely on sight.

**Special Senses.** You have [Darkvision](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) and [Truesight](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight), both with a range of 120 feet.

***Drawbacks.*** A [Light](/spells/2618996-light) spell cast on the robe or a [Daylight](/spells/2619083-daylight) spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives you the [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for *Light* or DC 15 for *Daylight*), ending the condition on yourself on a success.
