This small feather has a specific single use.
**Anchor:** You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means.  
**Bird:** You can use an action to toss the token into the air. The token disappears and a giant eagle appears.  
**Fan:** You can use an action to wave the token, causing it to flap like a wing.  
**Swan Boat:** You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water. The token disappears and a 50-foot-long, self-propelled boat in the shape of a swan appears.
**Tree:** You can use an action to touch the token to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and a 60-foot-tall oak tree springs into existence.
**Whip:** You can use an action to throw the token at a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place.
