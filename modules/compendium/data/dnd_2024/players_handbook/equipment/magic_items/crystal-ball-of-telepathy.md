Requires attunement. This crystal ball functions as a standard *crystal ball*. In addition, while touching it, you can use an action to cast the *telepathy* spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying. You don't need to concentrate on this *telepathy* to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends.
