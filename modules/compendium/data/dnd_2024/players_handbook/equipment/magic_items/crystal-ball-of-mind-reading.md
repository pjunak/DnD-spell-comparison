Requires attunement. This crystal ball functions as a standard *crystal ball*. In addition, while touching it, you can use an action to cast the *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this *detect thoughts* to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends.
