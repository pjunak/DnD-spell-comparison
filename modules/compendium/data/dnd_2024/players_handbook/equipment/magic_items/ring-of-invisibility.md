*Ring, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to give yourself the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition. You remain Invisible until the ring is removed or until you take a Bonus Action to become visible again.
