*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the DM.

The cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend 1 of the cube’s charges to cast one of the following spells using the cube.

***Gate.*** Pressing one side of the cube, you cast [Gate](/spells/2618932-gate), opening a portal to the plane of existence keyed to that side.

***Plane Shift.*** Pressing one side of the cube twice, you cast [Plane Shift](/spells/2618867-plane-shift), transporting the targets to the plane of existence keyed to that side.
