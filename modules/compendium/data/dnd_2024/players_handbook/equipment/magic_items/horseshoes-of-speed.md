*Wondrous Item, Rare*

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action.

While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, its Speed is increased by 30 feet.
