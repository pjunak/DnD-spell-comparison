This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 3 pounds. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you.
**Restraint:** On a hit (make a ranged attack roll), the sphere expands into iron bands that wrap around the creature. The creature is restrained until you use an action to speak the command word again.
**Escape:** A creature restrained by the bands can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to break free.
