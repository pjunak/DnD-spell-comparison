*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.

Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a [Study](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic) spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again.
