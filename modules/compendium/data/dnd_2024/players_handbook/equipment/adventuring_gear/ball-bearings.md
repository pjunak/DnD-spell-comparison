As a [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, you can spill Ball Bearings from their pouch. They spread to cover a level, 10-foot-square area within 10 feet of yourself. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition. It takes 10 minutes to recover the Ball Bearings.
