As a [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, you can wrap a Chain around an unwilling creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the [Grappled](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition), [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), or [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. If the creature’s legs are bound, the creature has the Restrained condition until it escapes. Escaping the Chain requires the creature to make a successful DC 18 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check as an action. Bursting the Chain requires a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check as an action.
