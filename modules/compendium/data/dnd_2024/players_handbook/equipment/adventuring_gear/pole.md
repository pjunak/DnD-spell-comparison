A Pole is 10 feet long. You can use it to touch something up to 10 feet away. If you must make a Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check as part of a [High](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HighJump) or [Long Jump](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongJump), you can use the Pole to vault, giving yourself [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the check.
