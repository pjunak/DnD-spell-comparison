A Tinderbox is a small container holding flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a [Candle](/equipment/501-candle), [Lamp](/equipment/496-lamp), Lantern, or [Torch](/equipment/437-torch)—or anything else with exposed fuel—takes a Bonus Action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.
