A Hooded Lantern burns [Oil](/equipment/393-oil) as fuel to cast [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 30-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 30 feet. As a Bonus Action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to Dim Light in a 5-foot radius, or raise it again.
