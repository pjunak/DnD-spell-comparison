This kit includes thread, needles, and scraps of cloth. You know how to work a loom, but such equipment is too large to transport.

**History:** Your expertise aids you in identifying cloth objects, including when they were created and their likely place or culture of origin.
**Investigation:** When you inspect a cloth object, your insight into the weaving process grants you knowledge of how it was made and what it might have been used for.
**Repair:** As part of a short rest, you can repair a single damaged cloth object.
