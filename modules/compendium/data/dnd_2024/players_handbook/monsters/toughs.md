  description: "The treant magically animates up to two trees it can see within 60\
    \ feet of itself. Each tree uses the Treant stat block, except it has Intelligence\
    \ and Charisma scores of 1, it can\u2019t speak, and it lacks this action. The\
    \ tree takes its turn immediately after the treant on the same Initiative count,\
    \ and it obeys the treant. A tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies,\
    \ the treant dies, or it is more than 120 feet from the treant. The tree then\
    \ takes root if possible."
