  description: "The cube moves up to its Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.\
    \ The cube can move through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures if it has\
    \ room inside itself to contain them (see the Ooze Cube trait). Dexterity Saving\
    \ Throw: DC 12, each creature whose space the cube enters for the first time during\
    \ this move. Failure: 10 (3d6) Acid damage, and the target is engulfed. An engulfed\
    \ target is suffocating, can\u2019t cast spells with a Verbal component, has the\
    \ Restrained condition, and takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the start of each of\
    \ the cube\u2019s turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed target moves with it.\
    \ An engulfed target can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength\
    \ (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the target escapes and enters the\
    \ nearest unoccupied space. Success: Half damage, and the target moves to an unoccupied\
    \ space within 5 feet of the cube. If there is no unoccupied space, the target\
    \ fails the save instead."
