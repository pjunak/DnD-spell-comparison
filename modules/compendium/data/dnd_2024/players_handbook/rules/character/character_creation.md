# Character Creation

Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a class (such as fighter or wizard), a background (such as sailor or acolyte), and a species (such as human or elf). You also invent the personality and appearance of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the D&D world.

## Step 1: Choose a Class

Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation.

Your character receives many benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are **class features**—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of **proficiencies**: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

## Step 2: Determine Origin

Your character's origin is defined by two choices: **Background** and **Species**.

### Choose a Background
Your background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard might have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have been a guild thief or a jester.

Your choice of background provides you with important benefits:
- **Ability Score Adjustments:** You increase two ability scores of your choice by +1, or one ability score by +2.
- **Feat:** You gain a specific Origin Feat.
- **Skill Proficiencies:** You gain proficiency in two specific skills.
- **Tool Proficiency:** You gain proficiency with a specific tool.
- **Equipment:** You start with a specific set of equipment and gold.

### Choose a Species
Your species contributes to your character's identity in an important way by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry.

Your choice of species provides you with:
- **Creature Type:** Usually Humanoid.
- **Size:** Small or Medium.
- **Speed:** Your base walking speed, usually 30 feet.
- **Special Traits:** Unique abilities like Darkvision, damage resistance, or innate magic.

## Step 3: Determine Ability Scores

Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**.

You generate your character's six ability scores using one of the following methods.

### Standard Array
Use the following six scores for your abilities: **15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8**. Assign them to your six abilities as you desire.

### Random Generation
Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. Assign these numbers to your six abilities as you desire.

### Point Buy
You have **27 points** to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown in the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases. You can't have a score lower than 8.

**Ability Score Point Cost**

| Score | Cost |
|---|---|
| 8 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |

## Step 4: Choose Alignment

Choose your character's alignment, which broadly describes his or her moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).

## Step 5: Starting Equipment

Your class and background determine your character's starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in the Equipment section.

Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of **Gold Pieces (gp)** to spend based on your class.

## Step 6: Come Together

Most D&D characters don't work alone. Each character plays a role within a **party**, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party's chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.
