The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.

### Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells

When you finish a Long Rest, you choose a type of land: Arid, Polar, Temperate, or Tropical. Until you finish your next Long Rest, you have the spells listed for that land type prepared.

| Druid Level | Arid | Polar | Temperate | Tropical |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 3rd | *Blur*, *Burning Hands* | *Fog Cloud*, *Hold Person* | *Misty Step*, *Sleep* | *Acid Spray*, *Web* |
| 5th | *Fireball*, *Melph's Acid Arrow* | *Sleet Storm*, *Spike Growth* | *Lightning Bolt*, *Plant Growth* | *Stinking Cloud*, *Water Walk* |
| 7th | *Blight*, *Hallucinatory Terrain* | *Ice Storm*, *Wall of Water* | *Confusion*, *Freedom of Movement* | *Giant Insect*, *Polymorph* |

### Level 3: Land's Aid

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to create a 10-foot-radius sphere within 60 feet. 

Each creature of your choice in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You also choose a creature in the sphere (which can be you). That creature regains 2d6 Hit Points.

Both the damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid level 10 and 14.

### Level 6: Natural Recovery

You can cast one of your Circle of the Land spells of level 1 or higher without expending a spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher.

### Level 10: Nature's Ward

You have Immunity to the Poisoned condition and Resistance to a damage type associated with your chosen land choice for level 3: Fire (Arid), Cold (Polar), Lightning (Temperate), or Poison (Tropical).

### Level 14: Nature's Sanctuary

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot cube on ground within 120 feet of you. The spectral flora lasts for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition or die.

You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area and gain the current Resistance of your Nature's Ward.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the spectral flora up to 60 feet to a space on the ground.
