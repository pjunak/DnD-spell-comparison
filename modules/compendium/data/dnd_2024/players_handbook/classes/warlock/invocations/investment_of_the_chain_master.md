Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain Invocation

When you cast Find Familiar, you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits.

Aerial or Aquatic. The familiar gains either a Fly Speed or a Swim Speed (your choice) of 40 feet.

Quick Attack. As a Bonus Action, you can command the familiar to take the Attack action.

Necrotic or Radiant Damage. Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.

Your Save DC. If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.

Resistance. When the familiar takes damage, you can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage.
