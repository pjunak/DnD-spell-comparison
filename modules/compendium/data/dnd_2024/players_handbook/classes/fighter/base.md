# Fighter

Fighters share a mastery of weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. They are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it in the face.

### Level 1: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice.

### Level 1: Second Wind

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. You can use a Bonus Action to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the Fighter Features table.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice, such as Longswords and Longbows. whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

### Level 2: Action Surge

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a Short or Long Rest before you can use it again. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on a turn.

### Level 2: Tactical Mind

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to add 1d10 to the roll. If this doesn't cause the roll to succeed, you don't expend the use.

### Level 3: Martial Archetype

You choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat style and techniques, such as Champion, Battle Master, Eldritch Knight, or Psi Warrior. The archetype you choose grants you features at level 3 and again at levels 7, 10, 15, and 18.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter levels 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 5: Tactical Shift

Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

### Level 9: Indomitable

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

You can use this feature twice between Long Rests starting at level 13 and three times starting at level 17.

### Level 11: Two Extra Attacks

You can attack three times instead of twice whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 13: Studied Attacks

You learn to predict your opponents' moves. If you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Combat Prowess is recommended.

### Level 20: Three Extra Attacks

You can attack four times instead of three whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
