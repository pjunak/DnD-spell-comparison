*Prerequisite: Level 4+, Dexterity 13+*

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Ignore Loading.** You ignore the Loading property of the Hand Crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, and Light Crossbow (all called crossbows elsewhere in this feat). If you're holding one of them, you can load a piece of ammunition into it even if you lack a free hand.

**Firing in Melee.** Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack rolls with crossbows.

**Dual Wielding.** When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the extra attack if that attack is with a crossbow that has the Light property and you aren't already adding that modifier to the damage.
