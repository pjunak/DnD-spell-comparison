*Prerequisite: Level 4+, Charisma 13+*

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Impersonation.** While you're disguised as a real or fictional person, you have Advantage on Charisma (Deception or Performance) checks to convince others that you are that person.

**Mimicry.** You can mimic the sounds of other creatures, including speech. A creature that hears the mimicry must succeed on a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine the effect is faked (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
