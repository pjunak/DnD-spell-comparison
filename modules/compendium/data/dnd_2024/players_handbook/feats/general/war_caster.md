*Prerequisite: Level 4+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic Feature*

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Concentration.** You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain Concentration.

**Reactive Spell.** When a creature provokes an Opportunity Attack from you by leaving your reach, you can take a Reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an Opportunity Attack. The spell must have a casting time of one action and must target only that creature.

**Somatic Components.** You can perform the Somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a Shield in one or both hands.
