You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Improved Dash.** When you take the Dash action, your Speed increases by 10 feet for that action.

**Charge Attack.** If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line toward a target immediately before hitting it with a melee attack roll as part of the Attack action, choose one of the following effects: gain a 1d8 bonus to the attack's damage roll, or push the target up to 10 feet away if it is no more than one size larger than you.
