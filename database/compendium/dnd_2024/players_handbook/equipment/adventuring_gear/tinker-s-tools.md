**History:** You can determine the age and origin of objects, even if you aren't familiar with their specific function.
**Investigation:** When you inspect a damaged object, you gain knowledge of how it was damaged and how long ago.
**Repair:** You can restore 10 hit points to a damaged object for each hour of work. For any object, you need access to the raw materials required to repair it. For metal objects, you need access to an open flame hot enough to make the metal pliable.
