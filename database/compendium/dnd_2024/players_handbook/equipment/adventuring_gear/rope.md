As a [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, you can tie a knot with Rope if you succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. The Rope can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

You can bind an unwilling creature with the Rope only if the creature has the [Grappled](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition), [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), or [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition. If the creature’s legs are bound, the creature has the Restrained condition until it escapes. Escaping the Rope requires the creature to make a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check as an action.
