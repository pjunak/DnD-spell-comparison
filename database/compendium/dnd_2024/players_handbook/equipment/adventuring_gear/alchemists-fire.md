When you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a flask of Alchemist’s Fire. Target one creature or object you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or take 1d4 Fire damage and start [burning](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurningHazard) (see the [Rules Glossary](/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#BurningHazard)).
