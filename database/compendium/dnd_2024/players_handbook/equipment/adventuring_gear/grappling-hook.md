As a [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, you can throw the Grappling Hook at a railing, a ledge, or another catch within 50 feet of yourself, and the hook catches on if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. If you tied a [Rope](/equipment/415-rope) to the hook, you can then climb it.
