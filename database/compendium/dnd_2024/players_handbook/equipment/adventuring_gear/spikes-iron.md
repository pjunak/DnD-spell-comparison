Iron Spikes come in bundles of ten. As a [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, you can use a blunt object, such as a [Light Hammer](/equipment/10-light-hammer), to hammer a spike into wood, earth, or a similar material. You can do so to jam a door shut or to then tie a [Rope](/equipment/415-rope) or [Chain](/equipment/521-chain) to the Spike.
