When you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a flask of Holy Water. Target one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or take 2d8 Radiant damage if it is a Fiend or an Undead.
