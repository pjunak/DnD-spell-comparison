As a [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, you can use Manacles to bind an unwilling Small or Medium creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the [Grappled](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition), [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), or [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. While bound, a creature has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls, and the creature is [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) if the Manacles are attached to a chain or hook that is fixed in place. Escaping the Manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check as an action. Bursting them requires a successful DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check as an action.

Each set of Manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use [Thieves’ Tools](/equipment/495-thieves-tools) to pick the Manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.
