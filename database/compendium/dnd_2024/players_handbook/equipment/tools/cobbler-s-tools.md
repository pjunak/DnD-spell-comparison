**Arcana, History:** Your knowledge of shoes aids you in identifying the magical properties of enchanted boots or the history of such items.
**Investigation:** Footwear holds a surprising amount of secrets. You can learn where someone has recently visited by examining the wear and the dirt that has accumulated on their shoes. Your proficiency with cobbler's tools grants you additional insight when making such an investigation.
**Maintain Shoes:** As part of a long rest, you can repair your companions' shoes. For the next 24 hours, up to six creatures of your choice who wear shoes you worked on can travel up to 10 hours a day without making saving throws to avoid exhaustion.
