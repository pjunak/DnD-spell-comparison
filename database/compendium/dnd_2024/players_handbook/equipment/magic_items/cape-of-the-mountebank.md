*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast [Dimension Door](/spells/2619100-dimension-door) as a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is [Lightly Obscured](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured) by that smoke until the end of your next turn.
