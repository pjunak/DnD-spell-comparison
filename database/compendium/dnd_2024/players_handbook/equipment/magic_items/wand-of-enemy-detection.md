*Wand, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to expend 1 charge. For 1 minute, you know the direction of the nearest creature [Hostile](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HostileAttitude) to you within 60 feet, but not its distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of Hostile creatures that are [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition), ethereal, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.

***Regaining Charges.*** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
