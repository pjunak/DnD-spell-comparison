*Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This rod has the following properties.

***Alertness.*** While holding the rod, you have Advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks and on Initiative rolls.

***Spells.*** While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

* [Detect Evil and Good](/spells/2619090-detect-evil-and-good)
* [Detect Magic](/spells/2619097-detect-magic)
* [Detect Poison and Disease](/spells/2619093-detect-poison-and-disease)
* [See Invisibility](/spells/2619011-see-invisibility)

***Protective Aura.*** As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 60-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 60 feet. While in that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can sense the location of any [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) creature that is also in the Bright Light.

The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
