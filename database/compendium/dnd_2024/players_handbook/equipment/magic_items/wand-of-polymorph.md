*Wand, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge to cast [Polymorph](/spells/2618876-polymorph) (save DC 15) from it.

***Regaining Charges.*** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
