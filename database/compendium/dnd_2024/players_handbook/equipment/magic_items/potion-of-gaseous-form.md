*Potion, Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [Gaseous Form](/spells/2618927-gaseous-form) spell for 1 hour (no [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) required) or until you end the effect as a Bonus Action.

This potion’s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
