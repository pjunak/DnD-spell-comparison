*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

While this pearl is on your person, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to regain one expended spell slot of level 3 or lower. Once you use the pearl, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
