*Wand, Uncommon*

This wand has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to expend 1 charge, and if a secret door or trap is within 60 feet of you, the wand pulses and points at the one nearest to you.
