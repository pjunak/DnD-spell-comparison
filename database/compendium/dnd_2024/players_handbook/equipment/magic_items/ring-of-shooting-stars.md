*Ring, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You can cast [Dancing Lights](/spells/2619058-dancing-lights) or [Light](/spells/2618996-light) from the ring.

The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.

***Faerie Fire.*** You can expend 1 charge to cast [Faerie Fire](/spells/2618858-faerie-fire) from the ring.

***Lightning Spheres.*** You can expend 2 charges as a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) in a 30-foot radius.

As a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn’t behind [Total Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover), the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

| Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 4d12 |
| 2 | 5d4 |
| 3 | 2d6 |
| 4 | 2d4 |

***Shooting Stars.*** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
