*Potion, Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the [Enlarge/Reduce](/spells/2619170-enlarge-reduce) spell for 1d4 hours (no [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) required).

The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
