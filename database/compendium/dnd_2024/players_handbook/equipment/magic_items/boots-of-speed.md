*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While you wear these boots, you can take a Bonus Action to click the boots’ heels together. If you do, the boots double your Speed, and any creature that makes an [Opportunity Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) against you has Disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When you’ve used the boots’ property for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you until you finish a Long Rest.
