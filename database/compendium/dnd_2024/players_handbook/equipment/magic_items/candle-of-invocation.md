*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This candle’s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have Advantage on [D20 Tests](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test). In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast [Gate](/spells/2618932-gate) with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the DM or determined by rolling on the following table.
