*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 60 [Arrows](/equipment/508-arrows), [Bolts](/equipment/510-bolts), or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 [Javelins](/equipment/8-javelin) or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows, [Quarterstaffs](/equipment/12-quarterstaff), or [Spears](/equipment/14-spear).

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
