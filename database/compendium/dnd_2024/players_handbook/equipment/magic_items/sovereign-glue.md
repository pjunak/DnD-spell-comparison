*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [Oil of Slipperiness](/magic-items/9228909-oil-of-slipperiness). When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of *Sovereign Glue* takes a [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [Universal Solvent](/magic-items/9229129-universal-solvent) or [Oil of Etherealness](/magic-items/4687-oil-of-etherealness), or with a [Wish](/spells/2619213-wish) spell.
