*Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While you wear this ring, [Difficult Terrain](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain) doesn’t cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce any of your Speeds nor cause you to have the [Paralyzed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition) or [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition.
