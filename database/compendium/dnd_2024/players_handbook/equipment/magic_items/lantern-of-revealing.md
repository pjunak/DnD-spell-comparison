*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 30-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 30 feet. [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern’s Bright Light. You can take a [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern’s light to Dim Light in a 5-foot radius.
