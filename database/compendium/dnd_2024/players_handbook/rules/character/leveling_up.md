# Leveling Up

As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.

## Experience Points

The Character Advancement table shows the XP you need to advance to each level and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. When your XP total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience Points column, you reach the corresponding level.

## Proficiency Bonus

The table also shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you'll be recording on your character sheet:

- Attack rolls using weapons you're proficient with
- Attack rolls with spells you cast
- Ability checks using skills you're proficient with
- Ability checks using tools you're proficient with
- Saving throws you're proficient with
- Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)

Your class determines your weapon skill and saving throw proficiencies. Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and divide it only once.

## Character Advancement Table

| Level | Experience Points | Proficiency Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | +2 |
| 2 | 300 | +2 |
| 3 | 900 | +2 |
| 4 | 2,700 | +2 |
| 5 | 6,500 | +3 |
| 6 | 14,000 | +3 |
| 7 | 23,000 | +3 |
| 8 | 34,000 | +3 |
| 9 | 48,000 | +4 |
| 10 | 64,000 | +4 |
| 11 | 85,000 | +4 |
| 12 | 100,000 | +4 |
| 13 | 120,000 | +5 |
| 14 | 140,000 | +5 |
| 15 | 165,000 | +5 |
| 16 | 195,000 | +5 |
| 17 | 225,000 | +6 |
| 18 | 265,000 | +6 |
| 19 | 305,000 | +6 |
| 20 | 355,000 | +6 |

## Gaining a Level

When you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, and when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score to 18, his Constitution modifier increases from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

## Tiers of Play

The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don't have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels.

- **Tier 1 (Levels 1-4):** Characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a wizard's Arcane Tradition or a fighter's Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages.
- **Tier 2 (Levels 5-10):** Characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as fireball and lightning bolt. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.
- **Tier 3 (Levels 11-16):** Characters have reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those attacks. These adventurers often confront threats to whole regions and continents.
- **Tier 4 (Levels 17-20):** Characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.
