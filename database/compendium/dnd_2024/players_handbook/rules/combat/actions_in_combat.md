# Actions in Combat

When you take your Action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise.

## Attack
*Action*

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the Fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

## Dash
*Action*

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your Speed, after applying any modifiers. With a Speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you Dash.

Any increase or decrease to your Speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your Speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash.

## Disengage
*Action*

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.

## Dodge
*Action*

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has **Disadvantage** if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with **Advantage**. You lose this benefit if you are Incapacitated or if your Speed is 0.

## Help
*Action*

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains **Advantage** on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with **Advantage**.

## Hide
*Action*

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for Hiding. If you succeed, you gain the **Invisible** condition.

## Influence
*Action*

You can use this action to attempt to influence a creature to do something. The DM determines when this action is available, and it typically requires a Charisma (Persuasion), Charisma (Deception), or Charisma (Intimidation) check.

## Magic
*Action*

When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action. See the "Spellcasting" rules for how to cast a spell.

## Ready
*Action*

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your Reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your Speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires Concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

## Search
*Action*

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

## Study
*Action*

When you take the Study action, you make an Intelligence check to study your memory, a book, a clue, or another source of knowledge. The DM determines the specific skill—such as Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion—that applies to the check.

## Use an Object
*Action*

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.
