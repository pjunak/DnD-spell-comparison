Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker believe that their anger is a source of power to be cultivated and unleashed. In battle, they lose themselves in a frenzy of bloodshed. Even outside combat, they are often on edge, their rage simmering just beneath the surface.

### Level 3: Frenzy

If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack.

### Level 6: Mindless Rage

You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your Rage is active.

### Level 10: Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

### Level 14: Intimidating Presence

 As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others. Choose a number of creatures equal to your Strength modifier within 30 feet of you. Each of them must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute.
 
 At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
 
 Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage to restore it.
