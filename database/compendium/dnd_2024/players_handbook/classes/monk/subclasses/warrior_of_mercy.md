*Manipulate Forces of Life and Death*

Warriors of Mercy manipulate the life force of others. These Monks are wandering physicians, but they bring a swift end to their enemies. They often wear masks, presenting themselves as faceless bringers of life and death.

### Level 3: Hand of Harm

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can expend 1 Focus Point to deal extra Necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Level 3: Hand of Healing

As a Magic action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to touch a creature and restore a number of Hit Points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier.

When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the Unarmed Strikes with a use of this feature without expending a Focus Point for the healing.

### Level 3: Implements of Mercy

You gain proficiency in the Insight and Medicine skills and proficiency with the Herbalism Kit.

### Level 6: Physician’s Touch

Your Hand of Harm and Hand of Healing improve, as detailed below.

**Hand of Harm.** When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can also give that creature the Poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.

**Hand of Healing.** When you use Hand of Healing, you can also end one of the following conditions on the creature you heal: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, or Stunned.

### Level 11: Flurry of Healing and Harm

When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the Unarmed Strikes with a use of Hand of Healing without expending Focus Points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an Unarmed Strike with Flurry of Blows and deal damage, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without expending a Focus Point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.

You can use these benefits a total number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 17: Hand of Ultimate Mercy

Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As a Magic action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 Focus Points. The creature then returns to life with a number of Hit Points equal to 4d10 plus your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died with any of the following conditions, the creature revives with the conditions removed: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, and Stunned.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
