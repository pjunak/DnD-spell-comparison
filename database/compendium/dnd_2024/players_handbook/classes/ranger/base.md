Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.

### Level 1: Favored Enemy

You are adept at hunting your foes. You always have the *Hunter's Mark* spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

The number of times you can cast it in this way increases when you reach certain Ranger levels: 3 times at level 5, 4 times at level 9, 5 times at level 13, and 6 times at level 17.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to produce effects of primal magic.

**Prepared Spells.** You prepare the list of Ranger spells that you don't have prepared.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

### Level 2: Deft Explorer

You have Advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track creatures.

In addition, you have Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks to recall information about terrain and foes.

### Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice.

### Level 3: Ranger Archetype

You choose an archetype that you strive to emulate, such as the Beast Master, Fey Wanderer, Gloom Stalker, or Hunter. The archetype you choose grants you features at level 3 and again at levels 7, 11, and 15.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 6: Roving

Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor. You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

### Level 9: Expertise

Choose two of your Skill Proficiencies. You gain Expertise in those skills.

### Level 10: Tireless

You can use a Magic action to give yourself Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier. You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a Short Rest, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.

### Level 13: Relentless Hunter

Taking damage can't break your Concentration on *Hunter's Mark*.

### Level 14: Nature's Veil

You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can become Invisible until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 17: Precise Hunter

You have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature marked by your *Hunter's Mark*.

### Level 18: Feral Senses

When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack roll.

You are also aware of the location of any Invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't Blinded or Deafened.

### Level 20: Foe Slayer

The damage die of your *Hunter's Mark* increases to a d10.
