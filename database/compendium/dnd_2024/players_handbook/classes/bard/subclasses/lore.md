Bards of the College of Lore know something about almost everything, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or performing elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

### Level 3: Cutting Words

You learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes a Damage Roll, an Ability Check, or an Attack Roll, you can use your Reaction to expend one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll.

You can use this feature after the creature rolls but before the DM determines whether the Attack Roll or Ability Check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage.

### Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell lists. These spells count as Bard spells for you, and are always prepared.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of these spells with another eligible spell.

### Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make an Ability Check or Attack Roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your d20, potentially turning a failure into a success.

If the check or attack still fails, the Bardic Inspiration die isn't expended.
