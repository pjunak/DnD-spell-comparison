You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.

### Level 3: Fast Hands

You can use the Bonus Action granted by your Cunning Action to take the Use an Object action, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, or use Thieves' Tools to disarm a trap or open a lock.

In addition, you can use a Bonus Action to take the Magic action to activate a Magic Item that requires that action.

### Level 3: Second-Story Work

You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.
In addition, when you make a jump, you can use your Dexterity score instead of your Strength score to determine the distance of your jump.

### Level 9: Supreme Sneak

You have Advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your Speed on the same turn.
In addition, if you are Hidden, attacks you make doesn't automatically give away your location.

### Level 13: Use Magic Device

You have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they aren't intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of Magic Items.

You gain an additional Attunement slot (for a maximum of 4).

Whenever you use a Magic Item property that expends a charge, roll a d6. On a roll of 6, you don't use a charge.
