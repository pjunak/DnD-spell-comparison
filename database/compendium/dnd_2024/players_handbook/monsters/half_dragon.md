  description: "The harpy sings a magical melody, which lasts until the harpy\u2019\
    s Concentration ends on it. Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 11, each Humanoid and Giant\
    \ in a 300-foot Emanation originating from the harpy when the song starts. Failure:\
    \ The target has the Charmed condition until the song ends and repeats the save\
    \ at the end of each of its turns. While Charmed, the target has the Incapacitated\
    \ condition and ignores the Luring Song of other harpies. If the target is more\
    \ than 5 feet from the harpy, the target moves on its turn toward the harpy by\
    \ the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the harpy. It doesn\u2019\
    t avoid Opportunity Attacks; however, before moving into damaging terrain (such\
    \ as lava or a pit) and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the\
    \ harpy, the target repeats the save. Success: The target is immune to this harpy\u2019\
    s Luring Song for 24 hours."
