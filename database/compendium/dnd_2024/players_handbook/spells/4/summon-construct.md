*Level 4 Conjuration (Artificer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a lockbox worth 400+ GP)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth the spirit of a Construct. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the **Construct Spirit** stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a material: Clay, Metal, or Stone. The creature resembles an animate statue (you determine the appearance) made of the chosen material, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot’s level for the spell’s level in the stat block.
