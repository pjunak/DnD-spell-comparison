# Sleet Storm
*3rd-Level Conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 150 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature umbrella)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius Cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. The area is Heavily Obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

Ground in the Cylinder is Difficult Terrain. When a creature enters the Cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition and lose Concentration.
