# Hypnotic Pattern
*3rd-Level Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** S, M (a pinch of confetti)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors in a 30-foot Cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who can see the pattern must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed, the creature has the Incapacitated condition and a Speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
