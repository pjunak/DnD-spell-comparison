*Level 3 Evocation (Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a silver pin worth 250+ GP)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Silver energy bursts out from you in a 120-foot-long, 5-foot-wide Line. Each creature of your choice in the Line makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 Force damage and has the Prone condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d10 for every spell slot level above 3.
