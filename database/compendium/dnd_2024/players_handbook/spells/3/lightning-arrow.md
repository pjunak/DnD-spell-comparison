# Lightning Arrow
*3rd-Level Transmutation (Ranger)*
**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting or missing a target with a ranged attack using a weapon
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

As your attack hits or misses the target, the weapon or ammunition you’re using transforms into a lightning bolt. Instead of taking any damage or other effects from the attack, the target takes 4d8 Lightning damage on a hit or half as much damage on a miss. Each creature within 10 feet of the target then makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The weapon or ammunition then returns to its normal form.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
