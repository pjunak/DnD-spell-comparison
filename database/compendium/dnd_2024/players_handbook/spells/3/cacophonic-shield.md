*Level 3 Evocation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Thunderous reverberations fill a 10-foot Emanation originating from you for the duration. Whenever the Emanation enters a creature’s space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 Thunder damage and has the Deafened condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn. When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it.

In addition, you have Resistance to Thunder damage, and ranged attack rolls against you are made with Disadvantage.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 3.
