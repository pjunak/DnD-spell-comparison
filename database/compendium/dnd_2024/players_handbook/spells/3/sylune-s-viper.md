*Level 3 Conjuration (Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a snake fang)

**Duration:** 1 hour

A shimmering, spectral snake encircles your body for the duration. You gain 15 Temporary Hit Points; the spell ends early if you have no Temporary Hit Points left.

While the spell is active, you gain the following benefits:

**Climbing.** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.

**Venomous Bite.** As a Magic action, you can make a ranged spell attack using the snake against one creature within 50 feet. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 Force damage and has the Poisoned condition until the start of your next turn. While Poisoned, the target has the Incapacitated condition.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** For each spell slot level above 3, the number of Temporary Hit Points you gain from this spell increases by 5, and the damage of Venomous Bite increases by 1d6.
