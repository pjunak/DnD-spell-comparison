*Level 5 Transmutation (Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a Quiver worth 1+ GP)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast the spell and as a Bonus Action until it ends, you can make two attacks with a weapon that fires Arrows or Bolts, such as a Longbow or a Light Crossbow. The spell magically creates the ammunition needed for each attack. Each Arrow or Bolt created by the spell deals damage like a nonmagical piece of ammunition of its kind and disintegrates immediately after it hits or misses.
