# Yolande's Regal Presence
*5th-Level Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature tiara)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You surround yourself with unearthly majesty in a 10-foot Emanation. Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 Psychic damage and has the Prone condition, and you can push it up to 10 feet away. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
