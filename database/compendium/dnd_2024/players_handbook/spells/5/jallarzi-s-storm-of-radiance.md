# Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance
*5th-Level Evocation (Warlock, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of phosphorus)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You unleash a storm of flashing light and raging thunder in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point you can see within range. While in this area, creatures have the Blinded and Deafened conditions, and they can’t cast spells with a Verbal component.

When the storm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 Radiant damage and 2d10 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Radiant and Thunder damage increase by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.
