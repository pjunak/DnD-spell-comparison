**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 60 feet

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point you can see within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each target regains Hit Points equal to 5d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.
