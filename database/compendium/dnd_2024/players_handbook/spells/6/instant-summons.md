*Level 6 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000+ GP)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch the sapphire used in the casting and an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an Invis- ible mark on that object and invisibly inscribes the object’s name on the sapphire. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire. Thereafter, you can take a Magic action to speak the object’s name and crush the sapphire. The ob- ject instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends. If another creature is holding or carrying the ob- ject, crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport it, but instead you learn who that creature is and where that creature is currently located.
