*Necromancy Cantrip (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the single chime of a dolorous bell is audible within 10 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 Necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its Hit Points, it instead takes 1d12 Necrotic damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by one die when you reach levels 5 (2d8 or 2d12), 11 (3d8 or 3d12), and 17 (4d8 or 4d12).
