*Transmutation Cantrip (Artificer, Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (the stem of a thorny plant)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a vine-like whip covered in thorns that lashes out at your command toward a creature in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, you can pull it up to 10 feet closer to you.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).
