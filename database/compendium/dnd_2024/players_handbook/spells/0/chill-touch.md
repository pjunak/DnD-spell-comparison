# Chill Touch
*Necromancy Cantrip (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Channeling the chill of the grave, make a melee spell attack against a target within reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 Necrotic damage, and it can’t regain Hit Points until the end of your next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10).
