*Level 8 Evocation (Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a glowing mote of energy that hovers above you for the duration. The mote sheds Bright Light in a 5-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 5 feet.

When you cast this spell and as a Bonus Action on later turns, you can unleash a shining bolt from the mote, targeting one creature within 120 feet of yourself. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes Force or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to 4d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

In addition, while the mote is present, you have Three-Quarters Cover, and if you succeed on a saving throw against a spell of level 7 or lower that targeted only you and didn’t create an area of effect, you can take a Reaction to deflect that spell back at the spell’s caster; the caster makes a saving throw against that spell using that caster’s own spell save DC.
