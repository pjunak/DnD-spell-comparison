# Hail of Thorns
*1st-Level Conjuration (Ranger)*
**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a Ranged weapon
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V
**Duration:** Instantaneous

As you hit the creature, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your Ranged weapon or ammunition. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 1.
