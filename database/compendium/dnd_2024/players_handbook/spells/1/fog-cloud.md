# Fog Cloud
*1st-Level Conjuration (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by Gust of Wind) disperses it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The fog’s radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
