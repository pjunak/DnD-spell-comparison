*Level 1 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)

**Duration:** 24 hours

Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can take a Bonus Action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 Hit Point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.
