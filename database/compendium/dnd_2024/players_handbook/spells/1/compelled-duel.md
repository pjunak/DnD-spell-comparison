*Level 1 Enchantment (Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You try to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it can't willingly move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you.

The spell ends if you make an attack roll against a creature other than the target, if you cast a spell on an enemy other than the target, if an ally of yours damages the target, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
