# Cloud Of Daggers
*2nd-Level Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a sliver of glass)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot Cube centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area takes 4d4 Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the Cube or ends its turn there or if the Cube moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.

On your later turns, you can take a Magic action to teleport the Cube up to 30 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 2d4 for each spell slot level above 2.
