# Shatter
*2nd-Level Evocation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has Disadvantage on the save.

A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.
