*Level 7 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You imbue one creature you touch with magical healing energy for the duration. Whenever the target casts a spell using a spell slot, the target can immediately roll a number of unexpended Hit Point Dice equal to the spell slot’s level and regain Hit Points equal to the roll’s total plus your spellcasting ability modifier; those dice are then expended.
