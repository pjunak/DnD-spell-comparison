# Arcane Sword
*7th-Level Evocation (Bard, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 90 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature sword worth 250+ GP)
**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration. When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On your later turns, you can take a Bonus Action to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one.
